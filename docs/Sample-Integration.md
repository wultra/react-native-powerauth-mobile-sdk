# Sample Integration

To better understand the APIs of the PowerAuth React Native SDK, we prepared a sample aplication.

## Demo application

Demo application with the integration of the PowerAuth React Native SDK can be found inside the `demoapp` folder of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk#docucheck-keep-link).

Visit [App.tsx](https://github.com/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk/blob/develop/demoapp/App.tsx#docucheck-keep-link) for example usage of the SDK.

**Note** that the example usage of the SDK is for demo purposes only and should not be considered as reference implementation.
