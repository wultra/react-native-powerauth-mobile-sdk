# PowerAuth SDK for React Native Mobile Apps

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk) ![released](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk)

In order to connect to the [PowerAuth](https://www.wultra.com/mobile-security-suite) service, mobile applications need to perform the required network and cryptographic processes, as described in the PowerAuth documentation. To simplify the implementation of these processes, developers can use React Native library (for Android and iOS) from this repository.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at the [Wultra Developer Portal](https://developers.wultra.com/products/mobile-security-suite/develop/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk/) or inside the [docs](docs) folder.
